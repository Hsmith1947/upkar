        <p class="modal-body">At The Upkar Project, child centric approach is the driving force of everything we do– from
            curriculum design to how our premises looks. We have taken into consideration that every
            space and activity provides a full measure of opportunities for the children to learn and
            thrive. Each day is a combination of individual and group activities, outdoor and indoor
            activities aimed at integrated development of a child. On the whole our aim at the project is
            to blossom a child&#39;s personality by making the most of the formative years in an ideal
            learning environment.</p>
            <p class="modal-body">The school aims at nurturing girls with values and competencies. We aim to accomplish it by
                giving right balance between curriculum and extra-curricular activities. We aim to help our
                students stand abreast with students across the globe. </p>
